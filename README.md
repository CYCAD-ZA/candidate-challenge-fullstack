# Full Stack Candidate Challenge Project
## INTRODUCTION

Briefco is South Africa's first and only legal cost consultancy leveraging technology to assist with the preparation of bills of costs and oppositions.

We leverage technology and experienced cost consultants to guarantee a maximum turnaround time of 5 days for the preparation of bills of costs.

BriefCo utilises its own secure online platform to allow attorneys to digitally delivery and store their documents, thereby reducing the significant costs associated with printing, delivery, and file preparation.

BriefCo's ground-breaking technology, which leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning, allows it to automate the preparation of and opposition to bills of costs. The time it takes for attorneys' clients to recover legal costs is thereby substantially reduced.

This challenge project will give you a glimpse into life as a developer at BriefCo

## WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

We're aiming to understand where you're at as a Full Stack Developer. We do not expect a production ready app, just enough for you to feel like you've communicated your level of skill to us.

We expect that this should take between 3-8 hours to complete, with at least another hour per bonus feature that you tackle. The idea that this is a big sacrifice of time is not lost on us! It's no small ask, but we find it important for the following reasons:

1. To give you time to decide if this is a product space that you could get excited about.
1. For us to be able to honestly evaluate your competence, style and approach for the job at hand.
1. For you to be forced to play with some of our unique stack. 

We will rate the delivered work based on the expected position level as follows:

### Junior Level
* A working project is nice, but not the most important thing
* *Bootstrap 4* should be used to enable a responsive design and to style the UI. This is actually very important, so don't choose a different CSS framework
* The Javascript framework is used in such a way that it displays a good understanding of how the chosen framework works
* The back end is architected in an understandable and maintainable way
* Include a Readme text file with any installation instructions you feel we need. Also add details for anything you found hard or confusing for this assessment

### Middle Level
* A working project
* *Bootstrap 4* should be used correctly to enable a responsive design and to style the UI into something decent
* The Javascript framework is used in such a way that it displays a good understanding of how the chosen framework works
* The back end is architected in an understandable and maintainable way
* Was testing considered and tried?
* Include a Readme text file with any installation instructions you feel we need

### Senior Level
* A working project
* The front end build setup shows a good understanding of how to configure a modern frontent pipeline and *Bootstrap 4* for development and production
* Bootstrap 4 should be used correctly to enable a responsive design and to style the UI into something decent
* The frontend framework is implemented as expected to produce a functional front end
* The back end is configured such that the basics for a new system are set up correctly
* The back end is architected in an understandable and maintainable way using up to date framework techniques
* Tests are expected, however, there does not need to be full coverage. It should be clear from the tests that are written that testing was planned
* Include a Readme text file with any installation instructions and other notes you feel we need
* Implementing extra features is a signal of planning well and of the ability to execute quickly

## THE CHALLENGE

Get into the head-space of buiding a document/file management system proof of concept. These are the main features we're after:

1. A Landing Page (which could also be the Login Page).
2. A Registration Page.
3. A Login Page.
4. A folder creation page. This is a page that allows logged in users to create folders where files will be uploaded to.
5. A file upload page.
6. A folder index page. This is a page where all folders are listed.
7. A file list page that shows all the files contained within a folder.

That makes up the base level of the application.

In Addition, we ask that you choose at least one bonus feature below to implement.  (You can definitely pick more than one if you're on a roll, or if you'd like to show off some of your other skills!)

### BONUS FEATURES:
* Use [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com) for some of the pages. You decide which pages would benefit the most
* Full CRUD functionality on files and folders
* Ability to open files (and possibly edit) in browser without needing to download
* Search functionality. Extra points for pagination and sorting
* Implement PurgeCSS (this is expected for the senior level assessment)
* Automated Tests

## WHAT IS EXPECTED IN YOUR TOOLBELT?
* A Modern Front End Framework: Alpine & Livewire preferred, but Vue/React can be used in a pinch. 
* [Bootstrap ](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) (We'd really like you to give it a try)
* [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com) for the backend. You can use anything for the DB. Please include migrations and seed data
* Github (or Bitbucket/Gitlab if you must!)

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Commit often, with meaningful commits. We'd rather see real commit history than it all magically coming together. Please start with one initial commit after starting with any framework / bootstrap code so that we can clearly distinguish where the community code ends and your code begins.

1. Complete at least the basic features plus 1 bonus feature.

1. This is a Full Stack challenge. We expect to see the best practices for both front and back end development. Depending on your chosen technologies, these include things like:
    * Adherance to community guidelines, standards and best practices
    * Component Driven Development
    * Routing
    * State Management
    * Clean Validation of all inputs
    * Functional Components
    * A clear, concise readme file with full setup instructions.

1. *Use Bootstrap for CSS.* We know you probably have never touched it before, but now's a great time to get your feet wet and be exposed to something new!  We will not be too opinionated on implementing a specific design. You're welcome to just replicate a document/file management platform that already exists or just free-style it yourself. We won't expect it to be perfect, but it should be clean, simple and work on mobile (Mobile First)
Remember, this is a development challenge, not a design challenge!

1. Once you're done, please drop us a link to your repo.

1. Feel free to host your completed project on a web accessible url. However, you will be judged based upon the code submitted and the 

1. We ask that you get this submitted within 10 days of receiving the challenge. If you need further time, just drop us a message and let us know.

That's it. If you're stuck with any of the above please reach out.

And search should have at least the following features.
 * Search by string matching in title
 * Search by file extension
